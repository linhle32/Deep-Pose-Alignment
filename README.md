# Deep pose alignment

## Summary
This deep learning architecture aligns human poses to be used in an exercise/rehabilitation assistant system. 

In short, the assistant system aims to provide users with visual feedback for their physical exercises. The feedback is generated by first extracting a user’s poses while they are performing an exercise through the video feed of the session. The extracted poses are then overlaid with the correct poses and display for the user to observe and fix their errors. 

#### An example of the full application (in development currently)

This model solves the task of aligning the user’s pose with the correct pose so that they can be overlaid on each other with minimal differences, including scales, locations, and perspectives. The architecture is summarized below. The model is trained by feeding it a set of correct pose, and a set of randomly distorted poses (changes in camera locations and perspectives). The model then learns to transform the distorted poses to align with correct ones with minimal errors.
